SwiftSockets
============

A simple GCD based socket library for Swift.

SwiftSockets is kind of a demo on how to integrate Swift with raw C APIs. More
for stealing Swift coding ideas than for actually using the code in a real
world project. In most real world Swift apps you have access to Cocoa, use it.

It also comes with a great Echo daemon as a demo, it's always there if you need
a chat.

**Note**: This is my first [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) project.
Any suggestions on how to improve the code are welcome. I expect lots and lots
:-)

###Targets

Updated for Swift 0.2 (aka Xcode 7.0).

The project includes three targets:
- SwiftSockets
- ARIEchoServer
- ARIFetch

I suggest you start out looking at the ARIEchoServer.

####SwiftSockets

A framework containing the socket classes and relevant extensions. It takes a
bit of inspiration from the [SOPE](http://sope.opengroupware.org) NGStreams
library.

Server Sample:
```swift
let socket = PassiveSocket<sockaddr_in>(address: sockaddr_in(port: 4242))!
  .listen(dispatch_get_global_queue(0, 0), backlog: 5) {
    print("Wait, someone is attempting to talk to me!")
    $0.close()
    print("All good, go ahead!")
  }
```

Client Sample:
```swift
let socket = ActiveSocket<sockaddr_in>()!
  .onRead { sock, _ in
    let (count, block, errno) = sock.read() // $0 for sock doesn't work anymore?
    guard count > 0 else {
      print("EOF, or great error handling \(errno).")
      return
    }
    print("Answer to ring,ring is: \(count) bytes: \(block)")
  }
  .connect("127.0.0.1:80") { socket in
    socket.write("Ring, ring!\r\n")
  }
```

####ARIEchoServer

Great echo server. This is actually a Cocoa app. Compile it, run it, then
connect to it in the Terminal.app via ```telnet 1337```.

####ARIFetch

Connects a socket to some end point, sends an HTTP/1.0 GET request with some
awesome headers, then shows the results the server sends. Cocoa app.

Why HTTP/1.0? Avoids redirects on www.apple.com :-)

###Why?!

This is an experiment to get acquainted with Swift. To check whether something
real can be implemented in 'pure' Swift. Meaning, without using any Objective-C
Cocoa classes (no NS'ism).
Or in other words: Can you use Swift without writing all the 'real' code in
wrapped Objective-C? :-)
